book in shambles when received
do not buy from this book from amazon.com llc .
i ordered this book earlier in the week with amazon prime for a going away gift .
i received the book today .
the party is tomorrow .
half of the book sleeve seems to have been cut off with an exacto knive , also leaving gashes in the book cover .
the packaging was fine .
i could return it but it wouldn 't come back before tomorrow .
spend extra and use another seller .
